Supply chain & data auditing

1. UML diagrams: Activity, Secuence, State and  Data Model

You can found the UML diagrams in the UML folder.


2. Libraries

I had some issues with the versions of truffle-contract.js and web3 and I had to update it.

I'm using truffle-test-utils for events validation, because I had problems with the examples in the started code with deprecations. I'm usign event assertions like this:
assert.web3Events(result, [{ event: 'Harvested' }]);

I'm usign truffle-hdwallet-provider and the project is published in Rinkeby network.


3. IPFS

Ipfs is not used in this project.

4. The project has 10 unit test:

truffle(develop)> test
Using network 'develop'.
